# diabetes-predictions
develop a predictive model to predict the diabetes onset over a follow-up of 10 years.

# Dataset:
The dataset is provided in the dataframe ‘data’ stored in the file ‘data_final_project.RData’.
The dataframe includes 25 variables (columns of the dataframe) collected in 3,264 subjects
(rows of the dataframe).
All the variables, except the outcome, were collected at the baseline time, i.e., the enrolment
of the subject in the study. At the baseline time all the subjects did not have diabetes. During
the follow-up period of 10 years, some of the subjects developed diabetes. The variable
‘outcome’ represents the diabetes status of each patient 10 years after the baseline:
• Outcome = 0 → 10 years after the baseline the subject did not have diabetes
• Outcome = 1 → 10 years after the baseline the subject had diabetes
All the available variables are described in Table 1.
Instructions for model development:
Develop and validate a predictive model that forecasts the diabetes status at 10 years
(outcome) using an optimal subset of the variables available at baseline.
